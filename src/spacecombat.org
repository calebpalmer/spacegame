  CLOSED: [2013-09-25 Wed 20:56]
Is VideoManager being inited before ship gets inited?

** DONE after update of game loop, everything is going too slow

The update functions of the entities were not converting the timestep to seconds properly.
They were doing 1.0 / timestep instead of timestep / 1000.0
** Does this game loop even work?
* Basic Enemy Fighters
* TODO Create Component system
** TODO change ship to a component
** TODO Do I model the map as a gameobject?
* ship input component
Right now the ship input component has a const velocity that it sets the position
